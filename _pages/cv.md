Education
======
* B.S. in Bioengineering, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, 2014-2018
* M.S. in Data Science, University of Pennsylvania, 2018-2020 (expected)

Research experience
======
* Early diseases detection based on electronic health records (EHRs) 								 08/2019 - Present
  * Improved  contextual  embedding  techniques  to  represent  different  medical  events on temporal sequence construction
  * Leveraged the patient-diagnosis projection similarity (PDPS) model to evaluate the similarity between the patientsâ€™ EHRs and the known diagnoses
  * Developed supervised learning models for early detection in patients with multi-diagnoses using transformed patient vectors

* Evaluation of interpretability via Model Extraction                                                                07/2019 - 08/2019
  * Revised a more interpretable model to approximate the blackbox models (e.g. random forests)
  * Performed the comparison analyses between the extracted model and base model
- Auto-Classification of Opioid-Related Tweets and Geolocation Monitoring                      02/2019 - 07/2019
  - Proposed a simple penalty-enhanced convolutional neural network model to deal with data imbalance
  - Performed geospatial correlation analyses between abuse data and the metrics from National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)
  - Generated geographic heatmaps, comparing different data granularity, to better visualize correlations
- Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) of HIV-1 Protease Inhibitors          07/2017 - 05/2018
  - Designed  a  set  of  web  crawlers  to  collect  the  SMILES  data  (chemical  structures)  of  the  inhibitors automatically
  - Took advantage of clustering techniques such as K-means, Self-organizing Maps for data splitting given limited sample size and obtained better-generalized models
  - Performed feature evaluation with further structure-based similarity analyses to identify the most contributing features to describe similar molecular properties
