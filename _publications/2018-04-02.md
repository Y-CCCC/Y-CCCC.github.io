# Abstract

D-glucaric acid is a promising platform compound used to synthesize many other value-added or commodity chemicals. The engineering of *Escherichia coli* for efficiently converting D-glucose to D-glucaric acid has been attempted for several years, with mixed sugar fermentation recently gaining growing interests due to the in- creased D-glucaric acid yield. Here, we co-expressed *cscB*, *cscA*, *cscK*, *ino1*, *miox*, *udh*, and *suhB* in *E. coli* BL21 (DE3), functionally constructing an unreported route from sucrose to D-glucaric acid. Further deletion of chromosomal *zwf*, *pgi*, *ptsG*, *uxaC*, *gudD*, over-expression of *glk*, and use of a D-fructose-dependent translation control system for *pgi* enabled the strain to use sucrose as the sole carbon source while achieving a high product titer and yield. The titer of D-glucaric acid in M9 medium containing 10 g/L sucrose reached ~1.42 g/L, with a yield of ~0.142 g/g on sucrose.
